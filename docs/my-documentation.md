# Documentation of creation of the Security Box


## 15-22 Feb

- I have been designing the box and having alot of questions, designing problems and so on. I'm using Autodesk fusion since that application allows me more features and precision. This box is very much about precision because of the solenoid lock that needs to be very EXACT in place because it only has approx 2mm space in the pin that can be used as a locking mechanism.

- I designed the box in that way so the stand for the solenoid is a special addon feature that I will glue into place, also in case it need reprinting, then i don't have to reprint the whole box, just the solenoid part or the drawer itself.

- Creating the box for the drawer and designing a space behind the inner drawer wall has been challenging and taken ALOT of time. I have finally decided to give 10mm space between drawer back wall and inner back wall for springs and reed sensor. Magnet will be glued on the back of the drawer and on closed position it will activate the reed sensor and the solenoid will hold the drawer. This needs extra presision and guidance for the drawer, that why I created walls, rails and more with standard 5mm. I also added a stopper feature in the box so the drawer locks into place before starting on the rail guidance.

- Today I'm finishing the box and minor features like holes for screws, I also created inwards extrudes for PCD chips for the OLED screen and the RFID scanner. Also the RFID scanner has a small ring opening where it's located so it's easier for signal to produce.

- Questions I have that only will be answered upon final printing and coding: 
  - Will the 2mm locking part of the solenoid truly hold the drawer in place, while springs are pushing it forwards?
  - When force is on this 2mm part of the solenoid from the springs, will the solenoid be stuck because of drawer pressure when activated or will it open?
